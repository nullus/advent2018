# Advent of Code 2018

## What

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Why

For fun ~~and profit~~

## How

Sometimes I'm not sure. Generally I commit the first solution that yields the correct answer, hopefully finding time to 
refactor my shame later.
